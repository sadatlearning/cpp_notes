## What is dangling modifier

- A **dangling modifier** is a descriptive word or phrase (usually at the beginning of a sentence) that is not clearly or logically connected to the word it is supposed to modify. 
  - As a result, the sentence may be confusing or unintentionally humorous.

### Example of a Dangling Modifier:

> **"Running down the street, the backpack fell off his shoulder."**

❌ Problem: It sounds like *the backpack* was running down the street, which doesn't make sense.

### How to Fix It:

You need to **clarify the subject** that the modifier is describing. Here's the corrected version:

> ✅ **"Running down the street, he felt the backpack fall off his shoulder."**

Now it's clear that *he* is the one running down the street, not the backpack.

### General Rule to Fix a Dangling Modifier:

* **Identify the modifier.**
* **Find the intended subject.**
* **Rewrite the sentence so the subject directly follows the modifier.**
