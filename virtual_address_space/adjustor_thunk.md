It seems like you might be referring to **"Adjustor Thunk,"** a term related to programming, particularly in the context of C++ and compiler-generated code.

### **What is an Adjustor Thunk?**
An **adjustor thunk** is a small piece of machine code generated by the compiler to adjust the `this` pointer when calling a member function, particularly in cases involving **multiple inheritance** or **virtual inheritance**.

### **Why is it Needed?**
In C++, when a class uses multiple inheritance, the position of the `this` pointer may need adjustment when calling a function from a different parent class. The compiler generates an **adjustor thunk** to correct the `this` pointer before invoking the actual function.

### **Example Scenario**
Consider:
```cpp
class Base1 {
public:
    virtual void foo() {}
};

class Base2 {
public:
    virtual void bar() {}
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    void bar() override {}
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    Base2* b2 = &d; // 'this' pointer may need adjustment
    b2->bar();      // Compiler inserts an adjustor thunk
}
```
Here, when calling `bar()` through a `Base2*`, the `this` pointer must be adjusted to point to the correct part of the `Derived` object. The compiler generates an **adjustor thunk** to handle this adjustment.

### **Key Points**
- Used in **multiple inheritance** and **virtual inheritance**.
- Ensures the correct `this` pointer is passed to member functions.
- Typically seen in compiled C++ binaries (e.g., in vtables).

Would you like a deeper explanation on how it works in assembly or virtual tables?
